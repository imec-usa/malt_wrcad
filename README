malt-3.1.0 released 01/09/2022

* The Yield command has been installed.

* New top-level build command (see below).  This generates output files
  only in ./build instead of within the source files.

To build malt, from the top directory (contains this README) give the command:
$ make

The malt executable produced is ./build/malt.

To rebuild malt, you can give the same command from the top level or
from ./build.
$ make

To reset everything, give this command at the top level.  This simply
deletes the build directory.
$ make clean
